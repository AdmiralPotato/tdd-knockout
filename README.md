Trying to wrap my head around how to approach Test Driven Development with Knockout JS

##Prerequisites / Setup and Install

Before you install this package, you must have the npm packages `grunt-cli` and `bower` installed globally on your system, or the installation will fail. If you need to install these packages, you may run the following command:

```
	npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

Users running Unix/Linux/OSX systems may need to prefix that command with `sudo`, or even be logged in as the local super user in order to successfully install these packages globally.

After `grunt-cli` and `bower` are installed, you may download the required dependencies for this project with the following command:

```
	npm install
```
